# Home Assistant Integration for Waterkotte Heatpumps [+2020]

![logo](https://github.com/marq24/ha-waterkotte/raw/master/logo.png)

This Home Assistant Integration is providing information from the German heatpump pioneer Waterkotte. In addition and where possible functions are provided to control the system.

All data will be fetched (or send) to your Waterkotte via the build in webserver of the unit. So the functionality is based on the data and settings that are available also via the frontend that you can directly access via a web-browser.

## Installation

### HACS

1. Add a custom integration repository to HACS: [ha-waterkotte](https://github.com/marq24/ha-waterkotte)
1. Install the custom integration
1. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Waterkotte Heatpump [+2020]"
1. Setup the waterkotte custom integration as described below

  <!--1. In HACS Store, search for [***marq24/ha-waterkotte***]-->

### Manual

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `waterkotte_heatpump`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/waterkotte_heatpump/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant
7. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Waterkotte Heatpump [+2020]"

## Adding or enabling the integration

### My Home Assistant (2021.3+)

Just click the following Button to start the configuration automatically:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=waterkotte)

### Manual

Use the following steps for a manual configuration by adding the custom integration using the web interface and follow instruction on screen:

- Go to `Configuration -> Integrations` and add "Waterkotte" integration
- Provide display name for the device, and it's address (hostname or IP)
- Select the number of TAGs that can be fetched in a single call to your device (older devices might need to adjust this value - for my in 2022 installed Waterkotte 75 is totally fine)
- Provide area where the heatpump is located

After the integration was added you can use the 'config' button to adjust your settings and you can additionally modify the update intervall

Please note, that most of the available sensors are __not__ enabled by default.

## Services

The Integration provides currently 4 services:

### Setting dates & times

- SET_HOLIDAY

  To set the times for the holiday mode use the provided service `waterkotte_heatpump.set_holiday` and set `start` and `end` parameter.

- SET_DISINFECTION_START_TIME

  To set the water disinfection start time (HH:MM) use the provided service `waterkotte_heatpump.set_disinfection_start_time` and set `starthhmm` parameter (seconds will be ignored).

### Get Energy Balance

- GET_ENERGY_BALANCE

  Retrieves the overall energy consumption data for the year

- GET_ENERGY_BALANCE_MONTHLY

  Retrieves the monthly breakdown energy consumption data for a moving 12 month window. 1 = January, 2 = February, etc...

## Troubleshooting

### Sessions

The Heatpump only allows 2 sessions and there is not way to close a session. Sometimes you will get an error about the login. Just wait a few minutes and it should auto correct itself. Session usually time out within about 5 min.

### Stale Data

The Heatpump will not always respond with data. This happens usually after the system changes status, e.g. start/stop the heating. There is not much we can do about this unfortunately. I try to cache the data in possible for a better UX.
