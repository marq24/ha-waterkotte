# Home Assistant Integration for Waterkotte Heatpumps [+2020]

![logo](https://github.com/marq24/ha-waterkotte/raw/main/logo.png)

This Home Assistant Integration is providing information from the German heatpump pioneer Waterkotte. In addition and where possible functions are provided to control the system.

All data will be fetched (or send) to your Waterkotte via the build in webserver of the unit. So the functionality is based on the data and settings that are available also via the frontend that you can directly access via a web-browser.

[[Get the sources for the sample dashboard_above](https://github.com/marq24/ha-waterkotte/blob/main/sample-view.yaml)] - Please note, that this sample dashboard makes use of the custom [multiple-entity-row](https://github.com/benct/lovelace-multiple-entity-row) frontend integration that need to be installed separately. 

## Installation
if you have installed the previous version of the waterkotte integration from me (marq24) - please [follow the migration guide](https://github.com/marq24/ha-waterkotte/blob/main/README.md#migration). 

### HACS

1. Add a custom integration repository to HACS: [ha-waterkotte](https://github.com/marq24/ha-waterkotte)
1. Install the custom integration
1. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Waterkotte Heatpump [+2020]"
1. Setup the waterkotte custom integration as described below

  <!--1. In HACS Store, search for [***marq24/ha-waterkotte***]-->

### Manual

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `waterkotte_heatpump`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/waterkotte_heatpump/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant
7. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Waterkotte Heatpump [+2020]"

## Adding or enabling the integration

### My Home Assistant (2021.3+)

Just click the following Button to start the configuration automatically:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=waterkotte)

### Manual

Use the following steps for a manual configuration by adding the custom integration using the web interface and follow instruction on screen:

- Go to `Configuration -> Integrations` and add "Waterkotte" integration
- Provide the IP address (or hostname) of your Waterkotte Heatpump web server
- Select the Interface-Type of your Waterkotte (when you need to provide the user & password 'waterkotte' to login via your app/browser, then select `EcoTouch Mode`)
- Select the number of TAGs that can be fetched in a single call to your device (older devices might need to adjust this value - for my in 2022 installed Waterkotte 75 is totally fine)
- Provide area where the heatpump is located

After the integration was added you can use the 'config' button to adjust your settings and you can additionally modify the update intervall

Please note, that most of the available sensors are __not__ enabled by default.

## Migration Guide

This is the new version of the previous 'ha-waterkotte' repository (which have now been renamed to [`ha-waterkotte-the-fork`](https://github.com/marq24/ha-waterkotte-the-fork)). After the refactoring process have been completed, I have decided to create an independent repository - since the refactored version does not have much in common with the origin sources.

Unfortunately HACS does not 'like' renaming of repositories, so you have to perform few steps in order to upgrade your home assistant installation to the latest ha-waterkotte integration version - sorry for this inconvenience!  

### How to migrate to the new integration version
1. make a backup (just in case)
2. go to HACS menu of your home assistant installation
3. remove the (old) custom HACS repository 'https://github.com/marq24/ha-waterkotte'

    (This step will/should remove the Waterkotte Integration entry from the list of installed HACS Integrations)
5. add the __new__ repository 'https://github.com/marq24/ha-waterkotte' to HACS
6. install the waterkotte integration to your local HACS
7. restart your home assistant system

YES - this procedure sounds *totally* silly - but HACS stores a custom-id for each repository - And since I have decided to rename the old repository which base on the work from pattisonmichael to 'https://github.com/marq24/ha-waterkotte-the-fork' and created an independent repository, this procedure is necessary in order to be notified about any future updates.

## Services

The Integration provides currently 4 services:

### Setting dates & times

- SET_HOLIDAY

  To set the times for the holiday mode use the provided service `waterkotte_heatpump.set_holiday` and set `start` and `end` parameter.

- SET_DISINFECTION_START_TIME

  To set the water disinfection start time (HH:MM) use the provided service `waterkotte_heatpump.set_disinfection_start_time` and set `starthhmm` parameter (seconds will be ignored).

### Get Energy Balance

- GET_ENERGY_BALANCE

  Retrieves the overall energy consumption data for the year

- GET_ENERGY_BALANCE_MONTHLY

  Retrieves the monthly breakdown energy consumption data for a moving 12 month window. 1 = January, 2 = February, etc...

## Troubleshooting

### Sessions

The Heatpump only allows 2 sessions and there is no way to close a session. Sometimes you will get an error about the login. Just wait a few minutes and it should autocorrect itself. Session usually time out within about 5 min.

### Stale Data

The Heatpump will not always respond with data. This happens usually after the system changes status, e.g. start/stop the heating. There is not much we can do about this, unfortunately. I try to cache the data in possible for a better UX.
